# Olympics FreeStyle Swimming Analysis
The goal of this project involves an analysis of swimming events from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. You will be working with and relying on the SwimmeR package in R for many of the tasks, alongside other packages such as ggplot2 for producing visualisation.

In competitive swimming, data is commonly released in the 'Omega' results format, and your ability to manipulate this data will be a valuable asset. You will be tasked with importing, cleaning, and processing data for analysis and modelling. Tasks include generating visualisations to identify performance patterns across events and constructing various regression models to understand the influences of different predictors on model accuracy.

There are 4 main parts to this project:
## 1. Data Import & Boxplot Visualization

## 2. Linear Regression Modelling

## 3. Multiple Regression Modelling and Swim Event Time Prediction

## 4. Data Visualization of Ariarne Titmusâ€™ Performance in the 400m Freestyle Events
